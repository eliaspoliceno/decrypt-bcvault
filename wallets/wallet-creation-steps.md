### Testing steps I have done:
In the previous tests, I have just revealed the private key of each wallet. Those wallets are in [old-wallets folder](old-wallets/).  

Recently, I created several wallets, but each one in the same address memory. I could do this by factory-resetting the device between each wallet creation. So, I have repeated these steps ten times:  

 1. Factory reset the device  
 2. Set global password to abc  
 3. Set global pin to 1234  
 4. Created a wallet:  
	 1. Of type blockchain type bitcoin  
	 2. With name "bitcoin" (without the quotes)  
	 3. With password abc  
	 4. With pin 1234.  
 5. Noted it's public address  
 6. Noted it's private key  
 7. Backed up  
 
 The wallets in current folder are the result of the above.
